abstract: To achieve lifelong human-agent interaction, dialogue agents need to constantly memorize perceived information and properly retrieve it for response generation (RG). While prior work focuses on getting rid of outdated memories to improve retrieval quality, we argue that such memories provide rich, important contextual cues for RG (e.g., changes in user behaviors) in long-term conversations. We present Theanine, a framework for LLM-based lifelong dialogue agents. Theanine discards memory removal and manages large-scale memories by linking them based on their temporal and cause-effect relation. Enabled by this linking structure, Theanine augments RG with memory timelines - series of memories representing the evolution or causality of relevant past events. Along with Theanine, we introduce TeaFarm, a counterfactual-driven evaluation scheme, addressing the limitation of G-Eval and human efforts in measuring memory-augmented dialogue agents.

summary: We present Theanine, a framework for lifelong dialogue agents that leverages temporal and causal relations between memories to improve response generation, along with TeaFarm, a novel evaluation scheme.
